# STM32F401RE Minimal FreeRTOS

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate building a [FreeRTOS](https://freertos.org) application with as few source files as possible. It uses [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org) and a lightly-forked [CMSIS-FreeRTOS](https://github.com/joshbrake/CMSIS-FreeRTOS) library to accomplish this goal.

It is included with several basic example in `/examples/` to illustrate basic tasks in FreeRTOS such as creating tasks, passing parameters, and demonstrating basic task priorities and preemption.
